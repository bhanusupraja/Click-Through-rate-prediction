# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) for online advertisements using logistic regression. CTR prediction is crucial in online advertising to evaluate ad performance and optimize ad placement strategies.

The dataset used in this project is provided by Avazu and spans 11 days of advertising data. The goal was to build and test prediction models that could potentially outperform standard classification algorithms for CTR prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Click**: Binary variable indicating if the ad was clicked (1) or not (0).
- **Hour**: Timestamp of the click in YYMMDDHH format.
- **Banner Position**: Position on the website where the ad was displayed.
- **Site ID**, **App ID**: Unique identifiers for sites and apps where ads were displayed.
- **Device Type**, **Device ID**, **Device IP**: Information about the device used to access the ad.
- **Other features**: Additional contextual features related to the ad and its display.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering: Extracting relevant features from timestamps, categorical variables, etc.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Logistic Regression: Chosen due to its interpretability and effectiveness for binary classification tasks like CTR prediction.
   - Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model performance using techniques such as grid search or randomized search.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics used: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), accuracy, precision, recall.
   - Cross-validation: Ensuring the model's generalizability using k-fold cross-validation.

## Results
- **Baseline Performance**: 
  - AUC-ROC score: 
  - Accuracy: 
  - Precision: 
  - Recall: 

- **Final Model Performance**:
  - AUC-ROC score: 
  - Accuracy: 
  - Precision: 
  - Recall: 

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model trained on Avazu data showed promising results in predicting CTR for online advertisements. Further optimizations and feature engineering could potentially improve the model's performance. The project was a casual exploration and did not participate in any competition, but the insights gained are valuable for understanding CTR prediction in online advertising.

## Future Steps
- Experiment with advanced modeling techniques such as gradient boosting machines or deep learning models.
- Explore ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.
- Deploy the model in a real-time bidding system to validate its performance in a live environment.
